"""An algorithm that asks a user to infinitely enter a positive number
until the user enters a zero value, and then determines and outputs
the largest of the inputted numbers."""




request user input for a positive integer
keep requesting number infinitely
when the user input is equal to 0
	find the max value of the inputted numbers
	print out largest number.

"""An algorithm for the flowchart"""



read in 2 values and assign them to X and Y respectively

add the two values together
store the added values in a variable named S

divide the sum by 2 ie. half the sum
store the division result in a variable named A

find the product of the 2 values ie. X times Y
store the product in a variable named P

print out S, A, P
