1. Plagiarism is a concept that describes the use of another person's intellectual property for personal use.
   The information could be gathered from a number of different sources.
   In essence, it is producing or publishing content that you are implying is your own without giving credit or acknowledgement to the original source or content creator.



2. Four different types of plagiarism:
   * Direct plagiarism - This is taking a person's work and copying it word for word in its entirety and passing it off as your own work without the inclusion of quotation marks or citing the original source.
   An example of this would be a copy and paste situation from a forum.


   * Self plagiarism - This type of plagiarism occurs when a person reuses material that they have previously used or published before.


   * Mosaic plagiarism - This type of plagiarism is when a person takes material from many different sources and patches it together with his/her own ideas and creates a finished product that they pass off as being their own in its entirety with the intention of not being detected by a single source.


   * Accidental plagiarism - We are constantly taking in information from many different sources as we are learning or researching ideas. When we formulate our own ideas, we may unknowingly use ideas that are from legitimate sources but we whole heartedly think that they are our own ideas that we formulated ourselves.



3. To avoid plagiarism we should strive to create and publish work that we have come up with ourselves. 
   If we are referencing the work of others, we need to correctly cite our sources and not make it seem as though the ideas of othes are actually our own.
